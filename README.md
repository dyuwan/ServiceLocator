# ServiceLocator

An application designed to facilitate the easy access of necessary details of a large number of various household service providers within a city.

The target solution is to create a database-powered portal with the following criteria:
1. Obtain the relevant location and core data of house service providers using web scraping of yellow pages-like sites.
2. Store the obtained data and service provider details in a local database.
3. Allow clients to browse and perform queries on the data through an app portal.
4. Provide facilities for matching customers and service providers.
